### Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create a simulated "pub" application that mimics 
standard real-world pub behavior. The application is designed using the following 
technologies and practices:
- **REST API**: The project revolves around a RESTful API for managing pub-related operations.
- **Spring Framework**
- **GitHub**
- **MySQL 8.0**
- **MVC Design Pattern**: Implementing a Model-View-Controller design pattern for a structured and modular codebase. 
**Model** represented by **Models**, **View** is represented by **Controllers**,
and **Controller** is represented by **Services**
- **Basic Authentication** (Spring Security)
